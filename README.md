## [DD2300 - Program-Cohesive-Course-In-Computer-Science](https://github.com/CasperKristiansson/Program-Cohesive-Course-In-Computer-Science-DD2300)
The Program Integrating Course runs through both years of the Master's Program in Computer Science at KTH. The course uses reflections as the main educational instrument.

You will learn why the compulsory courses are compulsory in the program and how these relate to each other, how you should select courses and specialization to become well-prepared for your future employment, and how to study to gain the most from the program.

The program integrating course each year simply consists of four one-hour seminars in groups of about a dozen first and second year students, together with a professor as a mentor. Since the program is quite large there are 24 parallel groups and 12 professors as mentors.

Each seminar has a topic, some links to texts to read or videos to look at, and some questions to think about. You will write a reflection on the topic and also on your current courses and studies. Thereafter you will should read and comment the other students' reflections and discuss them at a seminar.

This lecture covers the basics of game theory, as well as auction theory, which is an application domain of game theory. More specifically, this lecture describes basic auction mechanisms (e.g., ascending, descending, first-price, second-price) and their properties. Finally, this lecture covers mechanism design theory, which deals with a more general group decision making procedure.
